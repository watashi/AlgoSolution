# AlgoSolution

Solutions for Problems of Algorithm Contests and Online Judges.

## WARNING! SPOILER ALERT!!

Do **NOT** refer to these solutions before you think over the problems by
yourself. It is meaningless and does no good to anyone to blindly follow
and even copy other people's solutions.

## watashi/AlgoSolution

This is a private repository to maintain and share my own solutions.
Do **NOT** send pull request to this repository unless you are fixing some
bugs or submitting similar commits.

## AlgoFun/AlgoSolution

This is a public repository for collecting solutions to as many as possible
problems. If you have something to share, please send your pull request here.

Here are some basic rules to follow:

1. Keep the whole hierarchical structure clean and reasonable. Avoid path
too deep or single directory with too many files.
2. Name your solutions in a meaningful and consistent way. For example,
*$id[.$tag].$lang*. No whitespaces. No long and redundant names.
3. Code in a neat way. Some basic coding conventions should be followed.
Only special solutions for fun, e.g. extremely short solutions, may exempt
this rule.
4. Avoid duplicate solutions. There shall be only one solution for each
problem (through each approach (in each language)).
5. Spam (in comment) are not welcomed.
